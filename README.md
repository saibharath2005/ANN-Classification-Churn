# 📊 ChurnSenseProject - ANN-Based Customer Churn Classification

A deep learning project that predicts customer churn using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model. This project is designed as a complete pipeline — from preprocessing raw data to visualizing predictions using a **Streamlit web app**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction helps companies retain customers by identifying those likely to leave. This project uses a fully connected ANN model trained on customer data to predict churn probability.

The application is deployed locally using **Streamlit**, offering an intuitive UI to upload data, make predictions, and visualize outcomes.
